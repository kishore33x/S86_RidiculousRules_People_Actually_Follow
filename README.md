## 1.Project Title: "Ridiculous Rules People Actually Follow"

2.Project Overview:

This platform provides an uncommon way to engage through "Ridiculous Rules People Actually Follow," allowing individuals to share the most weirdly absurd rules of various aspects encountered in life and their institutions at school, at work, at public venues, and even everywhere else. Being a fun-loving community of social interaction with one's environment that finds a good deal of humour in things of the unusual policies, however passed.

The idea is based on the general phenomenon of running into rules that leave people looking puzzled, such as "no chewing gum on Wednesdays" or "employees must clock out before sneezing." These might be trivial or even ridiculous, but they exist, and often without much explanation. This project will create a space for users to contribute weird rules and interact with a community of similarly disposed individuals who have an interest in finding the absurdities of bureaucracy.

The app has a voting system where users can upvote or downvote the rules they find most ridiculous, giving the community a democratic way to highlight the most absurd submissions. The platform will also allow users to submit their own strange experiences, edit or delete their contributions, and even engage in conversations about why these rules might exist in the comment section. Furthermore, a leaderboard will categorize the most current and unusual rules which will increase engagement on their part.
